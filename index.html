                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    As a first-year Master's student in Biomedical Engineering at Técnico Lisboa, I specialize in Biomedical Imaging, Biosignals, and Biomedical Instrumentation while minoring in Artificial Intelligence. I'm passionate about applying my technical skills to develop intelligent healthcare solutions that improve access to medical care worldwide.
                    <br><br>
                    With a strong academic foundation (17/20 GPA in my BSc) and hands-on research experience, I combine engineering expertise with a deep interest in AI applications for healthcare. Beyond academics, I'm an avid cook, enjoy traveling, and appreciate musical theatre. I pride myself on being outgoing, organized, and hardworking - qualities that drive me to achieve my professional goals.
